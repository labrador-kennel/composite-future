# Contributing

In general this library is not looking to expand on the functionality provided. While tests over existing functionality 
would be appreciated it also would likely be overkill for the simple facade that is provided. If you do feel like your 
contribution would be warranted please create an Issue before writing any code so your changes can be discussed before 
any time may be wasted on code that won't get merged in.

If you do decide to submit a PR, please check out the [Contributing guide] at the [Labrador Governance repo] for more
information on contributing source code to this repository.
